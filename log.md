# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 2, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Created new projects, read through a pair of tutorials and watched a channel 9 video. The focus is ASP.Net Core authentication. I'd like to be able to use the API I'm building with a Xamarin mobile app. I'd also like a web front end because nothing annoys me more than those apps that have horrible/useless websites (I'm looking at you, Pinterest and Uber).

**Thoughts:** It wasn't really that difficult to set up individual accounts and authenticate users when I built [RubberCat](http://www.rubbercat.info). Why does dotnet seem like it's so much more complicated to set up? Looking to use JWT tokens, which should be fine for both web and native mobile clients.
