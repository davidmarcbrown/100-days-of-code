# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 2, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Created new projects, read through a pair of tutorials and watched a channel 9 video. The focus is ASP.Net Core authentication. I'd like to be able to use the API I'm building with a Xamarin mobile app. I'd also like a web front end because nothing annoys me more than those apps that have horrible/useless websites (I'm looking at you, Pinterest and Uber).

**Thoughts:** It wasn't really that difficult to set up individual accounts and authenticate users when I built [RubberCat](http://www.rubbercat.info). Why does dotnet seem like it's so much more complicated to set up? Looking to use JWT tokens, which should be fine for both web and native mobile clients.

### Day 2: June 3, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Returning to the stable dotnet framework. Which means, fortunately, that I have a project already started. Opening the TarefinhasAPI project in VS 2017 required some kind of migration to a new project format. But even though the migration results indicated the migration was a success it hung VS. I think I'll just start a new project from scratch. Sticking with VS 2017 just because.

Sifted through the SPA template and I think I can use this as a base, and modify it for my use.

**Thoughts:** Trying to build this with Core was a mistake. It's just not ready yet. Core web api templates with individual accounts are not expected until the 2.0 version, and the current version is 1.1, I believe. I'll use the .NET framework for now and host on Azure.

### Day 3: June 4, 2017
**Today's Goal:** I want to take a closer look at the authentication in the SPA template. Can this be used on non-web clients? I'd also like to create the models and set up the code first migrations.

**Today's Progress:** I didn't change the user model or create any other models. Looking for a thorough explanation of individual *local* accounts on web api 2. Found this.

**Thoughts:** It looks like having an identity server as part of the app might be what is needed to implement tokens on individual accounts. The tut below should have a hint.

### Day 4: June 5, 2017
**Today's Goal:** Walk through the tutorial in the link left in day 3. Build this sample app.

**Today's Progress:** I did my best to build the sample app from the instructions in the repo's readme, but unfortunately every call to the api would return the home view! I downloaded the sample project before I gave up for the evening and it works ok, so there must be a configuration issue with the template project in VS 2015. I tried VS 2017 at first, but I was unable to get https to work correctly.

**Thoughts:** I'm flabbergasted at the complexity of what should be a very simple task - authenticating individual accounts on a web api! I remember that Passport on Node way back when was a snap in comparison.

### Day 5: June 6, 2017
**Today's Goal:** I'm sure at this point I'll be sticking with the full dotnet framework, but I wanted to take a minute and look up token provision for Core. I'll compare those implementations with the OAuth provider libraries in the full framework. Specifically, I had re-read the [ASP.NET Core Token Auth Guide](https://stormpath.com/blog/token-authentication-asp-net-core) and looked over the code carefully. I'd like for the framework to handle the logistics of writing and reading user info (like hashed passwords) to the data store for me, and I think the full framework can do that while the Core library is still maturing. Going to run through the tutorial in today's first link.

**Thoughts:** I think I'll follow the third link's tutorial instead so I can focus on Identity.
